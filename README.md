# PebbleNotes
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarSoft/PebbleNotes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarSoft/PebbleNotes)

This is a Google Tasks client for Pebble smartwatch.
It allows read-only access and an ability to mark tasks as done/undone.

You may edit tasks with your preferred client: Gmail web interface,
GTasks android app, NoNonsenceNotes for Android or any iOS client.
As long as your tasks are synchronized with Google and you have
active Internet connection, you will see your latest notes/tasks.

## Requirements
Program must work on both Android and iOS devices, because it uses
JavaScript backend for accessing tasks.
It (currently) requires an Internet connection to be active!
